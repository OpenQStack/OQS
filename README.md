# OQS

**The Quantum Learning Stack. Built for minds, not just machines.**

OpenQStack is a modular, open-source platform for exploring, teaching, and prototyping quantum error correction (QEC). It is designed to reshape how we learn fault-tolerant quantum computing—from foundational codes to experimental decoders.

We don’t just simulate error correction.  
We enable students, educators, and researchers to build real understanding of how noise, measurement, and feedback interplay in quantum systems.

## Mission

To democratize quantum intuition.  
With OpenQStack, anyone—from undergraduates to PhD researchers—can simulate QEC codes, visualize logical qubits and recovery steps, and design new quantum feedback logic. All in pure Python.

## Features

- Run error correction simulations in minutes
- Visualize logical states, syndrome measurement, and recovery
- Modular API for building new codes, channels, and decoders
- Designed for use in teaching, research, and notebooks
- Includes support for bit-flip, depolarizing, and phase-flip noise
- Fully testable and pip-installable
