# --- SECTION 1 ---
# What is Quantum Error Correction?
# --------------------------------------------------
# Quantum information is fragile. Interactions with the environment (decoherence)
# can randomly flip qubits, leading to errors in computation or communication.
# The challenge is: How can we protect a fragile quantum state without violating the no-cloning theorem?

# """
# ## What is Quantum Error Correction?
# Quantum error correction (QEC) is the technique by which we protect quantum information from decoherence.
# Unlike classical error correction, we cannot simply copy quantum states due to the no-cloning theorem.
# Instead, we use entanglement and redundancy to encode information across multiple qubits in such a way
# that we can detect and correct errors.

# --- SECTION 2 ---
# Toy Model: Bit-Flip Noise
# --------------------------------------------------
# A bit-flip channel flips |0⟩ ↔ |1⟩ with probability p.
# This is analogous to a classical binary symmetric channel.

# """
# ## Toy Model: Bit-Flip Noise
# The bit-flip channel flips a qubit with some probability \( p \).
# We model this as a quantum operation using Kraus operators. This toy model helps us isolate and
# understand how QEC protects against a specific kind of noise.

# Bit-Flip Code: Encoding and Recovery
# --------------------------------------------------
# The 3-qubit Bit-Flip Code encodes a single qubit as:
#   |0⟩ → |000⟩, |1⟩ → |111⟩
# Majority vote allows detection and correction of a single flip.

# Markdown cell:
# """
# ## Bit-Flip Code: Encoding and Recovery
# To protect against bit-flip noise, we use the 3-qubit bit-flip code.
# This maps a logical qubit into three physical qubits using redundancy:
# \[
# |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \Rightarrow \alpha|000\rangle + \beta|111\rangle
# \]
# If any one of the three qubits flips, we can use majority voting to recover the original logical state.

# ## Exercises
# 1. Change the initial state |\psi⟩ to different values (e.g., |+⟩, |−⟩, |i⟩) and observe how QEC performs.
# 2. Replace the bit-flip noise with a depolarizing channel and rerun the simulation. What happens?
# 3. Implement a simple 1-qubit phase-flip code. Does it protect against bit-flip noise?
# 4. Try applying 2 bit-flips to the 3-qubit code. Can it recover? Why or why not?

# ## Summary
# We introduced quantum error correction by exploring how the 3-qubit Bit-Flip Code protects a quantum state.
